## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Tool Nexus Portal seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to [security@tool-nexus-portal.com] with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report"
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After submitting a report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
4. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to your report promptly and work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not take legal action against you if you:
  - Follow responsible disclosure practices
  - Do not access or modify user data
  - Do not perform actions that could harm our users or services
  - Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have addressed it

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Use proper escaping for user-generated content
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up to date and audit for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data to the repository
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

### Development Environment

- Use the latest stable versions of Node.js and npm
- Regularly update development dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Enable security linting rules in your IDE

### Code Review

- All code changes must be reviewed before merging
- Security-focused code review for authentication and data handling
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Security Features

### Client-Side Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Local Processing**: All tools process data locally in the browser
- **No Data Transmission**: User data is never sent to external servers

### Dependency Security

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Trusted package sources only

## Known Security Considerations

### Browser Security

- Tool Nexus Portal runs entirely in the browser
- No server-side processing of user data
- Users should ensure their browsers are up to date
- Be cautious when processing sensitive data in shared environments

### Third-Party Dependencies

- We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Dependencies are kept to a minimum
- All dependencies are from trusted sources

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed. Users will be notified through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Project README updates

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The main Tool Nexus Portal application
- All tools and utilities included in the platform
- Build and deployment scripts
- Documentation and examples

## Out of Scope

- Third-party services or websites linked from our application
- User's local environment security
- Browser vulnerabilities (please report to browser vendors)
- Social engineering attacks

## Security Hall of Fame
